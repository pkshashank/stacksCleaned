DEF	  A topological space MATH is called quasi-compact if for any open covering MATH there is a finite subset MATH such that MATH.  
DEF	  A topological space MATH is said to verify the separation axiom MATH if for any pair of points MATH, MATH there is an open subset of MATH containing one but not the other. We say that MATH is Hausdorff if for any pair MATH, MATH there are disjoint open subsets MATH such that MATH and MATH.  
DEF	  A topological space MATH is called irreducible if MATH is not empty and if MATH with MATH closed, then either MATH or MATH. A subset MATH of a topological space is called irreducible if it is an irreducible topological space with the topology induced from MATH. This definition implies MATH is irreducible if and only if the closure MATH of MATH in MATH is irreducible.  
DEF	  A point MATH of an irreducible topological space MATH is called a generic point of MATH if MATH is equal to the closure of the subset MATH.  
DEF	  A topological space MATH is called Noetherian if any decreasing sequence MATH of closed subsets of MATH stabilizes. (It is called Artinian if any increasing sequence of closed subsets stabilizes.)

We will say that MATH is locally finite if all of the MATH are finite MATH-modules. Suppose that MATH is a Noetherian ring and that MATH is a Euler-Poincare function on finite MATH-modules. This means that for every finitely generated MATH-module MATH we are given an integer MATH and for every short exact sequence MATH we have MATH. The Hilbert function of a locally finite graded module MATH (with respect to MATH) is the function MATH. We say that MATH has a Hilbert polynomial if there is some numerical polynomial MATH such that MATH for all sufficiently large integers MATH.

Finally, a graded module MATH over a graded MATH-algebra MATH is given by a graded MATH-module MATH together with a (compatible) MATH-module structure such that MATH. Now you can define homomorphisms of graded modules/rings, graded submodules, graded ideals, exact sequences of graded modules, etc, etc.  
DEF	  Let MATH be a graded ring. A homogeneous ideal is simply an ideal MATH which is also a graded submodule of MATH. Equivalently, it is an ideal generated by homogeneous elements. Equivalently, if MATH and MATH is the decomposition of MATH into homogeneous pieces in MATH then MATH for each MATH.  
DEF	  We define the homogeneous spectrum MATH of the graded ring MATH to be the set of homogeneous, prime ideals MATH of MATH such that MATH. Note that MATH is a subset of MATH and hence has a natural induced topology.  
DEF	  Let MATH be a graded ring, let MATH and assume that MATH. We define MATH to be the subring of MATH consisting of elements of the form MATH with MATH homogeneous and MATH. Furthermore, we define MATH Finally, for a homogeneous ideal MATH we define MATH.

DEF	  A scheme MATH is called integral if MATH is nonempty and for every nonempty affine open MATH the ring MATH is a domain.  
DEF	  For any ring MATH we denote MATH the ring of dual numbers. As an MATH-module it is free with basis MATH, MATH. The ring structure comes from setting MATH.  
DEF	  Let MATH be a morphism of schemes. Let MATH. We dub the set of dotted arrows of Exercise REF the tangent space of MATH over MATH and we denote it MATH. An element of this space is called a tangent vector of MATH at MATH.

DEF	  Let MATH be a locally ringed space. The Picard group of MATH is the set MATH of isomorphism classes of invertible MATH-modules with addition given by tensor product. See Modules, Definition REF. For a ring MATH we set MATH.  
DEF	  (Definition of delta.) Suppose that MATH is a short exact sequence of abelian sheaves on any topological space MATH. The boundary map MATH is defined as follows. Take an element MATH. Choose an open covering MATH such that for each MATH there exists a section MATH lifting the restriction of MATH to MATH. Then consider the assignment MATH This is clearly a 1-coboundary in the Cech complex MATH. But we observe that (thinking of MATH as a subsheaf of MATH) the RHS always is a section of MATH over MATH. Hence we see that the assignment defines a 1-cochain in the complex MATH. The cohomology class of this 1-cochain is by definition MATH.
