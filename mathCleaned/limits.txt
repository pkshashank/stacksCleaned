LEMMA	  Notation and assumptions as in Lemma REF. If MATH is flat and of finite presentation, then there exists an MATH such that for MATH we have MATH is flat, MATH, and MATH.  
LEMMA	  Notation and assumptions as in Lemma REF. If MATH is smooth, then there exists an MATH such that for MATH we have MATH is smooth.  
LEMMA	  Notation and assumptions as in Lemma REF. If MATH is proper, then there exists an MATH such that for MATH we have MATH is proper.  
LEMMA	  In Situation REF suppose that we have a cartesian diagram MATH of schemes quasi-separated and of finite type over MATH. For each MATH choose MATH and a diagram MATH as in (REF). Let MATH be the corresponding limit descriptions as in Lemma REF. Let MATH, MATH, MATH, and MATH be the corresponding morphisms of systems constructed in Lemma REF. Then there exists an MATH such that for MATH we have MATH and such that MATH is a closed immersion. If MATH and MATH are flat and of finite presentation, then there exists an MATH such that for MATH the last displayed morphism is an isomorphism.
