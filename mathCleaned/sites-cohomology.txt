LEM	  Let MATH be a site with final object MATH. Let MATH be a ring. Let MATH be objects of MATH with MATH perfect. Let MATH be map in MATH. There exists a covering MATH such that MATH is equal to MATH for some map MATH in MATH.  
LEM	  Let MATH be a site. Let MATH be a Noetherian ring. Let MATH. If the cohomology sheaves of MATH and MATH are locally constant sheaves of MATH-modules of finite type, then the cohomology sheaves of MATH are locally constant sheaves of MATH-modules of finite type.
