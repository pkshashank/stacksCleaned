LEMMA	  Any fpqc covering is a V covering. A fortiori, any fppf, syntomic, smooth, etale or Zariski covering is a V covering. Also, a ph covering is a V covering.  
DEFNN	  Let MATH be a contravariant functor on the category of schemes with values in sets. We say that MATH satisfies the sheaf property for the V topology if it satisfies the sheaf property for any V covering (see Definition REF).  
LEMMA	  Let MATH be a contravariant functor on the category of schemes with values in sets. Then MATH satisfies the sheaf property for the V topology if and only if it satisfies <CASES> CASE: the sheaf property for every Zariski covering, and CASE: the sheaf property for any standard V covering. </CASES> Moreover, in the presence of (1) property (2) is equivalent to property <CASES> CASE: the sheaf property for a standard V covering of the form MATH, i.e., consisting of a single arrow. </CASES>  
LEMMA	  Let MATH be a quasi-compact morphism of schemes. The following are equivalent <CASES> CASE: MATH is a V covering, CASE: for any valuation ring MATH and morphism MATH there exists an extension of valuation rings MATH and a commutative diagram MATH CASE: for any morphism MATH and specialization MATH of points in MATH, there is a specialization MATH of points in MATH mapping to MATH. </CASES>  
LEMMA	  Let MATH be a V covering. Then MATH is a universally submersive morphism of schemes (Morphisms, Definition REF).  
LEMMA	  Any set of big Zariski sites is contained in a common big Zariski site. The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for big fppf and big etale sites.  
LEMMA	  Let MATH. Suppose given big sites MATH and MATH. Assume that MATH is contained in MATH. The inclusion functor MATH satisfies the assumptions of Sites, Lemma REF. There are morphisms of topoi MATH such that MATH. For any object MATH of MATH the inclusion functor MATH satisfies the assumptions of Sites, Lemma REF also. Hence similarly we obtain morphisms MATH with MATH.  
LEMMA	  Let MATH be a scheme. Let MATH be a full subcategory of the category MATH of all schemes over MATH. Assume <CASES> CASE: if MATH is an object of MATH and MATH is an affine open, then MATH is isomorphic to an object of MATH, CASE: if MATH is an affine scheme lying over an affine open MATH such that MATH is of finite presentation, then MATH is isomorphic to an object of MATH. </CASES> Let MATH be a functor. Assume <CASES> CASE: for any Zariski covering MATH with MATH objects of MATH we have the sheaf condition for MATH and this family, CASE: if MATH is a directed limit of affine schemes over MATH with MATH objects of MATH, then MATH. </CASES> Then there is a unique way to extend MATH to a functor MATH satisfying the analogues of (a) and (b), i.e., MATH satisfies the sheaf condition for any Zariski covering and MATH whenever MATH is a directed limit of affine schemes over MATH.  
LEMMA	  Let MATH. Let MATH be an affine scheme which is written as a limit MATH of a directed inverse system of affine schemes. <CASES> CASE: Let MATH be a standard MATH-covering of MATH, see Definitions REF, REF, REF, REF, and REF. Then there exists an index MATH and a standard MATH-covering MATH whose base change MATH to MATH is isomorphic to MATH. CASE: Let MATH, MATH be a pair of standard MATH-coverings of MATH. If MATH is a morphism of coverings of MATH, then there exists an index MATH and a morphism MATH whose base change to MATH is MATH. CASE: If MATH are morphisms of standard MATH-coverings of MATH whose base changes MATH to MATH are equal then there exists an index MATH such that MATH. </CASES> In other words, the category of standard MATH-coverings of MATH is the colimit over MATH of the categories of standard MATH-coverings of MATH.  
LEMMA	  Let MATH, MATH, MATH satisfy conditions (1), (2), (a), and (b) of Lemma REF and denote MATH the unique extension constructed in the lemma. Let MATH. Assume <CASES> CASE: for any standard MATH-covering MATH of affines in MATH such that MATH factors through an affine open MATH and MATH is of finite presentation, the sheaf condition hold for MATH and MATH. </CASES> Then MATH satisfies the sheaf condition for all MATH-coverings.  
LEMMA	  Let MATH. Let MATH be a scheme contained in a big site MATH. Let MATH be a MATH-sheaf satisfying property (b) of Lemma REF with MATH. Then the extension MATH of MATH to the category of all schemes over MATH satisfies the sheaf condition for all MATH-coverings.
